## Overview

The `flux install` command adds new dependencies to your project. It’s optimized for speed and works with zero external cache, using Flux's custom dependency graph resolver.

---

## Usage

```bash title="Terminal"
flux install [package-name...]
```

---

## Examples

<Tabs items={["Install Specific Packages", "Install All Packages"]}>

<Tab>

#### Install Specific Packages

```bash title="Terminal"
flux install react react-dom
```

This installs `react` and `react-dom` and adds them to your `dependencies` in `package.json`.

</Tab>

<Tab>

#### Install All Dependencies

```bash title="Terminal"
flux install
```

Installs all dependencies listed in your `package.json` file.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Options

| Option             | Description                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `--dev`            | Install as a devDependency          |
| `--exact`          | Save exact versions (no ^ or \~)    |
| `--no-save`        | Don’t update `package.json`         |
| `--prefer-offline` | Use local cache only (if available) |

## How It Works

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Resolves dependencies <br />
        Flux calculates the optimal graph and fetches only the required versions of each package.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Downloads and links packages <br />
        Files are placed directly in your `node_modules` with no symlink chaos.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Updates `package.json` and `flux.lock` <br />
        Ensures consistent, repeatable installs across environments.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Performance Tip

Flux skips unnecessary steps like global cache lookups, which makes it **faster** than npm, yarn, and pnpm in most cases — especially on CI or fresh installs.
