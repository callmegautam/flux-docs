## Overview

The `flux outdated` command shows which of your dependencies are outdated — comparing the versions currently installed with the latest available in the registry.

This allows you to stay on top of updates, including **patches**, **minor**, and **major** changes.

---

## Usage

```bash title="Terminal"
flux outdated
```

---

## Example Output

```text title="Terminal"
Package     Current   Latest   Type
--------    -------   ------   ------
react       18.2.0    18.3.0   dependency
eslint      8.50.0    8.55.0   devDependency
axios       1.4.0     1.6.0    dependency
```

---

## Features

-   Lists all outdated packages in a clear, tabular format
-   Separates dependencies and devDependencies
-   Indicates the type of version bump (patch, minor, major) _(coming soon)_
-   Designed to be much faster than `npm outdated`, `yarn outdated`, or `pnpm outdated`
