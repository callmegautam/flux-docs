## Overview

The `flux update` command upgrades the specified packages — or all dependencies — to their latest versions. It ensures updates are **safe**, **deterministic**, and **fast**, thanks to Flux's lockfile strategy.

---

## Usage

```bash title="Terminal"
flux update [package-name...]
```

---

## Examples

<Tabs items={["Update Specific Packages", "Update All Packages"]}> 
<Tab>

#### Update Specific Packages

```bash title="Terminal"
flux update react react-dom
```

This upgrades `react` and `react-dom` to their latest versions as allowed by the version range in `package.json`.

</Tab>

<Tab>

#### Update All Packages

```bash title="Terminal"
flux update
```

This upgrades all dependencies listed in `package.json` to their latest compatible versions.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## How It Works

<Steps>
    <Step>
        #### Scans current versions <br />
        Flux reads your `package.json` and compares it with the latest versions available.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Applies version rules <br />
        Flux respects semver ranges unless `--latest` is used.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Updates `package.json` and `flux.lock` <br />
        Ensures both reflect the updated versions and remain in sync.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        #### Installs updated dependencies <br />
        Flux installs only the changed packages, not the whole tree.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Performance

Thanks to its smart diffing and deterministic resolution, `flux update` is significantly faster than `npm update` and `yarn upgrade`.
