## Overview

The `flux run` command lets you run scripts defined in your project's `package.json` file. It’s a fast, zero-overhead alternative to `npm run`, `yarn run`, and `pnpm run`.

---

## Usage

```bash title="Terminal"
flux run <script-name>
```

---

## Example

```bash title="Terminal"
flux run dev
```

This will run the `dev` script from your `package.json`, like:

```json title="package.json"
{
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev"
    }
}
```

---

## Features

-   **Faster** than `npm run`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` because it doesn’t spawn unnecessary subprocesses.
-   **Sane defaults** for environment variables and PATH resolution.
-   Works seamlessly with monorepos and workspaces.
