## Overview

The `flux reinstall` command removes your existing `node_modules` and lockfile, then performs a clean installation of all dependencies.

It’s especially useful when:

-   Your dependency tree is broken or corrupted
-   You want to ensure a fresh, deterministic install
-   You just cloned a project and want a clean setup

---

## Usage

```bash title="Terminal"
flux reinstall
```

---

## What It Does

<Steps>
  <Step>
  #### Deletes Existing Modules  
  Removes the `node_modules` folder from your project directory.
  </Step>

<Step>
    #### Resets the Lockfile <br />
    Deletes your `flux.lock` (or `lock.json`) file.
</Step>

  <Step>
  #### Reinstalls Dependencies  
  Rebuilds the dependency graph from `package.json` and installs all packages from scratch.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## When to Use

-   After switching branches where dependencies changed
-   When facing strange errors like mismatched versions or missing binaries
-   To clean up corrupted installs or leftover modules
-   Before committing/pushing to make sure your lockfile is clean

---

## Example

```bash title="Terminal"
flux reinstall
```

This will fully reset the project’s dependency tree and regenerate a fresh `flux.lock` file.

---

## Benefits

-   Ensures consistency between local and CI environments
-   Helps avoid hard-to-detect bugs caused by stale `node_modules`
-   Safer and faster than manually deleting folders or using `rm -rf`
