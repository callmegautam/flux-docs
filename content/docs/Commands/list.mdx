## Overview

The `flux list` command displays all currently installed dependencies in your project. This includes both direct and development dependencies, pulled from `package.json` and resolved via the lockfile.

---

## Usage

```bash title="Terminal"
flux list
```

---

## Example Output

```text title="Terminal"
dependencies:
  react: 18.3.0
  react-dom: 18.3.0
  axios: 1.6.0

devDependencies:
  typescript: 5.3.3
  eslint: 8.55.0
```

---

## Features

-   Shows both `dependencies` and `devDependencies`
-   Reads from `flux.lock` for accurate, resolved versions
-   Faster and cleaner than `npm list`, `yarn list`, or `pnpm list`
-   Helps confirm what’s actually installed vs. declared
