## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

-   [Installed Flux](https://fluxdocs.gautamsuthar.in/docs/installation) on your system
-   Node.js 16.0.0 or later
-   Basic familiarity with package managers and the command line

## Creating a New Project

<Steps>
    <Step>
    
    #### Create a New Project Directory

    Let's start by creating a new project with Flux. Open your terminal and run the following command:

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    flux init my-project
    ```

    This command creates a new directory called my-project with a basic project structure and a default flux.config.js file.

    </Step>

    <Step>
    #### Navigate to Your Project Directory
    Change into your project directory by running:

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    cd my-project
    ```
    </Step>

</Steps>

---

## Project Structure

The basic project structure created by Flux looks like this:

<Files>
    <Folder name="my-project" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="node_modules" />
        <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
            <File name="index.js" />
            <File name="app.js" />
        </Folder>
        <File name="flux.config.js" />
        <File name="package.json" />
        <File name="README.md" />
    </Folder>
</Files>

The <code>flux.config.js</code> file contains the configuration for your Flux project. You can customize this file to suit your needs.

---

## Installing Dependencies

Let's add some dependencies to our project. With Flux, you can use the add command to install packages:

```bash title="Terminal"
flux add react react-dom
```

This command installs the React and React-DOM packages and adds them to your project's dependencies.

---

## Running Scripts

<Steps>

    <Step>

    #### Add a Script to Your Project
    You can add scripts to your project by modifying the <code>package.json</code> file. For example, you can add a script to start your development server:

    ```json
    {
        "scripts": {
            "dev": "tsx src/index.ts",
            "build": "tsx src/index.ts --build"
        }
    }
    ```

    </Step>



    <Step>

    #### Start the Development Server

    To start your project, you can use the run command. For example, to start a development server, run:

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    flux run dev
    ```

    This command starts the development server.

    </Step>

    <Step>

    #### Build Your Project

    To build your project for production, you can run:

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    flux run build
    ```

    This command compiles your project and prepares it for deployment.

    </Step>

</Steps>
