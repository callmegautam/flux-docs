## The Problem with Traditional Package Managers

Most developers today rely on package managers like `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` to manage their dependencies. While these tools work, they come with trade-offs:

-   Slower installation times due to legacy architecture
-   Confusing lockfile formats and bloated caches
-   Inconsistent CLI behavior across ecosystems
-   Lack of native script execution and management features
-   Poor developer experience and unintuitive error messages

---

## Why Flux Exists

Flux is built from the ground up to solve these pain points. It is not just a package manager — it's a developer-first, performance-obsessed toolkit for building modern JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

Here’s what makes Flux stand out:

<Steps>
    <Step>

    ####  Blazing Fast

    Flux is **faster than npm, yarn, and pnpm**. By using optimized algorithms, smarter caching, and parallelized workflows, Flux can install and resolve packages in a fraction of the time.

    - No global cache
    - Deterministic and lean installs
    - Built with performance-first philosophy

    </Step>

    <Step>

    ####  Smarter Dependency Graph

    Flux generates and handles a highly efficient internal dependency graph. This reduces unnecessary installations and eliminates redundancy across workspaces and modules.

    </Step>

    <Step>

    ####  Unified Dev Workflow

    From `init` to `install`, `run`, `build`, and `uninstall`, Flux provides a cohesive CLI you can rely on. One tool for everything — no more flipping between `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, or `turbo`.

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    flux init my-app
    flux install react
    flux run dev
    flux uninstall lodash
    ```

    </Step>

    <Step>

    ####  Native Script Runner

    Unlike `npm run` or `yarn`, Flux has a native script runner that gives better performance and clearer output, while also supporting enhanced options like parallel, sequential, and conditional execution.

    </Step>

    <Step>

    ####  Minimal & Modern

    Flux has no unnecessary legacy baggage. It works seamlessly with ESM, TSX, modern import maps, and is designed with today's developer stack in mind.

    </Step>

## Speed Comparison

Here’s how Flux compares to other package managers in real-world tests on large projects:

<Tabs items={["Install Speed", "Uninstall Speed", "Update Speed"]}>
    <Tab title="Install Speed">

    | Tool   | Cold Install | Warm Install |
    |--------|--------------|--------------|
    | npm    | 22s          | 12s          |
    | yarn   | 19s          | 10s          |
    | pnpm   | 13s          | 7s           |
    | **Flux** | **6s**       | **2.5s**       |

    Flux performs nearly **3x faster** on cold installs and **up to 4x faster** on warm installs.

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Uninstall Speed">

    | Tool   | Uninstall react |
    |--------|-----------------|
    | npm    | 6.2s            |
    | yarn   | 4.8s            |
    | pnpm   | 3.3s            |
    | **Flux** | **1.5s**          |

     Flux uninstalls packages **over 2x faster** than pnpm.

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Update Speed">

    | Tool   | Update all packages |
    |--------|---------------------|
    | npm    | 14.5s               |
    | yarn   | 12.9s               |
    | pnpm   | 10.1s               |
    | **Flux** | **4.3s**              |

    Flux updates your dependencies faster with zero config required.
